  <p>
      Hi, I’m Brandon White <br>
      A New Web Developer<br> Eager to Build & Create. <br>
      <br>
      Welcome to my portfolio! I’m a passionate <br>
      and driven web developer who’s excited<br>
      to dive into the world of coding. Though<br> 
      I’m just starting my journey in web development,<br> 
      I’ve already built a solid foundation in HTML.<br>
      <br>
      I’m committed to learning and growing, and<br> 
      I’m ready to take on new challenges to build<br> 
      functional, visually appealing websites.
      <br>Every project I create is an opportunity to<br>
       learn something new and apply my skills in fresh,<br> 
       innovative ways. My goal is to craft websites that<br> 
       are not only aesthetically pleasing but also<br>user-friendly and responsive.
      Take a look at my work,<br> and feel free to reach out if you’re interested in<br>
      collaborating or if you have any questions!
